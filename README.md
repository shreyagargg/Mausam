This is my first project utilizing the OpenWeatherAPI. Currently, the application provides basic information, such as location and temperature. However, I am working on expanding its functionality to include additional features, such as historical weather data for the past week and future weather predictions.

If you have any suggestions or if there is any way you can assist in improving this project, your input would be highly appreciated.
